			<h2>var AND let</h2>
			<p>In swift, we represent variable as var and chracter as let. it is represented as var cat = "mycat". To print var , we just have to type print(cat). in swift , we worked in a playground. we must need a mac book to learn swift, although online compiler is available for the use and offline compiler can be downloaded from github.</p>
